### Open Source Usage

If you would like to use this code and add onto it or provide a new feature you are welcome to. But, in order to compile the code you will need to do one thing.
* You will need to add a plist file named `Keys` under the `Resource` group in Xcode. 
* Then you will need to add two keys, `production` and `development`. 
* Once you have that, you will need to get your respective API key from developer.haloapi.com. If you do not have keys you will need to sign up for the Halo API and get access, those steps are found on their website. 
* Once you have those keys, insert the values into the plist. You might not have a production key, which is fine, you will really only need a development key to do whatever you need to do. 

Once you have that set up you should be good to go!
